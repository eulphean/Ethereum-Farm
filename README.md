# Ethereum-Farm
Ethereum Farm was developed by Amay Kataria as part of a commission by the interdisciplinary artist [Stephanie Rothenberg](https://stephanierothenberg.com/) for the show Re:Working Labour at the Sullivan Galleries in Chicago. Ethereum Farm is a live data visualization of the Ethereum Blockchain. It plants pending transactions (green dots) that are broadcasted on the Ethereum network and marks them as mined (white dots) whenever a new block is created with such transactions. Over time, the farm actively keeps getting populated with pending and mined transactions that visualizes the dynamic operating frequency of the Ethereum Blockchain.
