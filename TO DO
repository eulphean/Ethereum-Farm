Function:
// GUI controls: Set the capacity of the farm. 
// Capacity determines how many cells can be planted with transactions
// If that capacity is reached, then other transactions will be ignored. 
// Farm has to wait for those transactions to be mined or attended to. 
// Mouse press to hide/show the GUI controls. 

// Design the frame for the metrics to be show. 
// Some design cycles before I can start coding the frame. 
// How will I loop between multiple metrics of the farm. 

Aesthetics: 
// Animations for cells getting populated.
